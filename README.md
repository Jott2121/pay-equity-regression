# Compensation Equity Analysis

Regression-based pay equity audit — the methodology used by major comp consulting firms (Mercer, WTW, Aon) for annual pay reviews. Identifies pay variation associated with gender or race **after** controlling for legitimate drivers (level, function, location, tenure, experience, performance, management status).

**Built by a former Fortune 500 talent acquisition leader applying statistical methods to one of HR's highest-stakes problems.**

## Why this matters

A headline statistic like *"women are paid 18% less than men"* is almost always reported as an unadjusted median gap. That number mixes together:

- **Explainable drivers** — different role mix, different tenure, different experience levels.
- **Unexplainable residuals** — pay variation that doesn't track any legitimate driver.

Only the residual is the lever HR and comp teams can actually act on. A pay equity audit isolates it.

**Business stakes:**

- **Legal exposure.** Pay discrimination litigation averages $2–20M in settlements. Proactive audit + remediation is a fraction of that.
- **Regulatory.** EU Pay Transparency Directive (in force 2026), UK Equality Act, California SB-1162, NYC Pay Transparency Law — all require pay equity disclosures or evidence.
- **Retention.** Underpaid employees leave at higher rates, and the knowledge spreads (Glassdoor, levels.fyi).

## Methodology

A standard two-stage regression approach:

### Stage 1 — Model log(salary) on legitimate drivers

```
log(salary) ~ C(level) + C(function) + C(location) 
            + years_at_company + years_experience 
            + C(performance_rating) + is_people_manager
```

We log-transform salary because comp effects are multiplicative (a 10% level premium is 10% whether you're an L2 or L7). Residuals of this model represent the portion of each employee's pay *not* explained by legitimate drivers.

### Stage 2 — Test if residuals vary by protected class

```
residual ~ is_female
residual ~ is_urm
```

A significant non-zero coefficient means there is pay variation associated with gender/race that the legitimate-driver model cannot explain.

### Recovered gaps (on simulated data with known ground truth)

Injected gaps: 5% gender, 3% URM race.

```
Legitimate-driver model R² = 0.991

--- Gender (Female vs Male) ---
  Unexplained gap:        +5.12%
  95% CI:                 [+4.78%, +5.46%]
  p-value:                < 0.001
  Employees below parity: 791
  Remediation cost:       $6,494,879

--- Race (URM vs non-URM) ---
  Unexplained gap:        +2.57%
  95% CI:                 [+2.13%, +3.01%]
  p-value:                < 0.001
```

Recovered gaps match the injected values within tight confidence intervals — the methodology works.

## What the visualizations show

### Raw vs adjusted

![Raw vs adjusted](docs/raw_vs_adjusted_gap.png)

The raw median gap overstates the actionable gap because it mixes role mix with pay discrimination. The adjusted gap is what matters.

### Residual distribution by gender

![Residual distribution](docs/residual_distribution.png)

The Female residual distribution is shifted left of zero — individually small, but consistent enough that it's statistically unmistakable across thousands of employees.

### Where the gap concentrates

![Gap by level](docs/gap_by_level.png)

Almost every level shows an unexplained gap in the same direction, which is the signature of a systemic effect rather than noise from a single outlier team.

## Why simulated data?

Real workforce compensation data is essentially never public. Public pay datasets (BLS, federal payroll) lack the demographic + level + function granularity needed to demonstrate an audit.

Simulation has a meaningful advantage for a portfolio demo: **we know the ground truth**. If the methodology works, it should recover the injected gap within its confidence interval — and it does (5.12% recovered vs 5.00% injected).

The simulator (`src/simulate.py`) is calibrated against:

- Level salary bands from Radford / Levels.fyi / BLS SOC 15-2051 (2024)
- Geographic comp multipliers from public tech comp reports
- Function premiums consistent with 2024 Mercer comp data
- Performance-based pay variance typical of structured merit programs

All relationships are tunable via the `GapConfig` dataclass. Set gap to zero and the audit confirms no unexplained variance — a sanity check for the methodology itself.

## Interactive dashboard

A multi-page Streamlit app ships with the repo:

| Page | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Headline KPIs + full audit report; configure workforce size and injected gaps live |
| **🔍 Gap Explorer** | Drill down by level, function, location; residual distribution |
| **💰 Remediation Planner** | Employee-level shortfall list + budget-aware funding curve (what does $X million actually cover?) |

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

**Tableau / Power BI users:** generate Tableau-ready CSVs:
```bash
python -m src.export_tableau  # writes tableau/workforce_with_residuals.csv + tableau/gap_by_segment.csv
```
Then follow [docs/TABLEAU.md](docs/TABLEAU.md) for the recipe to build five dashboard views.

## Run the core audit scripts

```bash
python -m src.audit         # runs audit, prints report
python -m src.visualize     # regenerates the visualizations
jupyter lab notebooks/01_equity_audit.ipynb
```

## What a serious HR reviewer will push back on

I've flagged these myself inside the notebook, but they deserve their own section because they're the conversations any real audit actually lives and dies on:

1. **"Legitimate drivers" is a judgment call.** Using *level* as a control masks any discrimination that manifests through *leveling*. If women are systematically under-leveled, the gender gap partially hides inside `C(level)`. A complete audit adds a second-order analysis: promotion velocity and leveling decisions by demographic group.

2. **Small subgroup sizes.** With 2,500 employees we can say something about the Female/Male gap overall. We *cannot* reliably detect a Black Women gap if there are only ~60 Black women in the sample — the confidence intervals would be too wide. Intersectional analyses need larger populations or industry benchmarks.

3. **Correlation ≠ causation.** A statistically significant gap is evidence of *something*. Discrimination is one possibility; another is unmeasured confounders (market pay shifts in specific roles, lateral hiring below band, transfer dynamics). The audit surfaces the residual; it doesn't name the cause.

4. **The remediation dollar figure is an upper bound.** Real remediation applies thresholds (e.g. only gaps >2%), phased budgets, and manager input. The quoted number is the naive "close every shortfall completely" estimate.
